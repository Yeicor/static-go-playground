# Production build (main)

To deploy on your own static web server, you just need to copy these files as needed:

- Full app: The files in the root folder (without any subfolders or .nojekyll).
- [wasm_exec.js](wasm_exec/wasm_exec.js): The subfolder wasm_exec is the standalone wasm_exec.js demo.

The hosted version of the full app is available at https://Yeicor/static-go-playground.github.io/ and the 
wasm_exec.js standalone demo is available at https://Yeicor/static-go-playground.github.io/wasm_exec/.
